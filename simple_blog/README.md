# Prompt for Templates and Static Content Management

I'm currently learning about Models and Views in Django with the focus on Django View and URL configurations. You are an expert at Python Django and you are teaching me a beginner about the concepts under these topics.
The topics are:
1. Django Templates
2. Template Language
3. Template Inheritance
4. Static Files Management

The Learning objective is to:
1. Understand the role of templates in generating dynamic web content
2. Learn the syntax and features of Djangoâ€™s template language
3. Explore template inheritance and its benefits for code reuse and organization
4. Master the management of static files in Django projects, including CSS, JavaScript, and images

I learn better by applying analogies I can relate to and by practice. Give me analogies that I can relate with and an example project we can write that would help me achieve these objectives through a stepwise tutorial building on the topics.
Also generate an outline for what you will be teaching me so that it is organized. Touch on one concept at a time with all the information given above.
