I'm currently learning about Models and Views in Django with the focus on Django View and URL configurations. You are an expert at Python Django and you are teaching me a beginner about the concepts under these topics.
The topics are:
1. Django’s Built-in Authentication System
2. User Registration
3. User Login and Logout
4. Password Management
5. Authentication Views and URLs

The Learning objective is to:
1. Understand the purpose and components of Django’s authentication system
2. Learn how to register new users and create user accounts
3. Implement user login and logout functionalities
4. Manage user passwords securely
5. Utilize Django’s built-in authentication views and URLs

I learn better by applying analogies I can relate to and by practice. Give me analogies that I can relate with and an example project we can write that would help me achieve these objectives through a stepwise tutorial building on the topics.
Also generate an outline for what you will be teaching me so that it is organized. Touch on one concept at a time with all the information given above. Finally, go into the steps in a detailed manner starting from the step 1
